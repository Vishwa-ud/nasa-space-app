}

```
3. In Server.js
```
app.use(cors({
    origin: 'https://yourwebappname.vercel.app', // Include your Frontend Domain address

## API Integration

### how to use the APIs.

### Generate API Key 
 - [Link to nasa open api](https://api.nasa.gov/)
 - signup and get key via email
 - use .env to keep api key secured no one can see.

## APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day)

### Overview
 NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API to fetch daily images and related information about space and astronomy. The APOD API provides a rich source of fascinating images along with their descriptions, which  utilize to enhance the user experience of our application.


 ### Fetching Data from NASA API

fetch data from the NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) API to retrieve the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) and related information. Here's an overview of how fetch and cache data from the NASA API:

### Fetching Process
use JavaScript's built-in `fetch` function to make HTTP requests to the NASA APOD API endpoint. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

1. **API Endpoint**:  construct the API request URL using the base URL `https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod` and include our NASA API key as a query parameter (`api_key`). The API key is securely stored in our application environment.

2. **Local Data Cache**: Before making a request to the API, check if the data for the current day is available in the local storage cache. generate a unique cache key based on the current date and prefix it with 'NASA-' (e.g., `NASA-Sun Apr 25 2024`). If data for the current date is found in the cache, retrieve and use it, skipping the API request.

3. **Fetching Data**: If the data for the current day is not available in the cache, proceed to make a request to the NASA API using the constructed URL.  use `fetch` to perform an asynchronous HTTP GET request to the API endpoint.

4. **Processing Response**: Upon receiving a response from the API,  extract the JSON data using the `json` method. The fetched APOD data typically includes information such as the image URL, title, date, and explanation.

5. **Caching Data**: Once  receive the data from the API,  store it in the local storage cache using the unique cache key generated earlier. This cached data allows us to avoid making redundant API requests for the same day in future application sessions.

6. **Error Handling**:  handle any errors that occur during the API request or data processing. If an error occurs, log the error message to the console for debugging purposes.


### Challenges Faced
During the integration of the APOD API, encountered several challenges:

1. **API Key Management**: Initially, managing the API key securely posed a challenge.  needed a reliable method to securely store and retrieve the API key without exposing it in our codebase.

2. **Caching Data**: Another challenge was efficiently caching fetched data to minimize unnecessary API calls. aimed to store the retrieved APOD data locally to reduce network requests and improve application performance.

### Resolutions
To address the challenges faced during API integration,  implemented the following solutions:

1. **Secure API Key Handling**:  leveraged environment variables and configuration files to securely manage the API key. By storing the API key in an environment variable,  ensured that it remained private and inaccessible to unauthorized users.

2. **Data Caching**: To optimize performance and minimize API calls,  implemented a caching mechanism using browser local storage. Upon fetching data from the APOD API, stored it locally, associating each entry with the current date. Subsequent requests for the same date retrieved the data from the local cache instead of making additional API calls, reducing network overhead.

### Conclusion
Integrating the APOD API into our project proved to be a valuable addition, enriching the user experience with captivating images and informative content about space and astronomy. By overcoming challenges such as API key management and data caching,  ensured the smooth functioning and optimal performance of our application.

## EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera)

 ### Overview
 NASA EPIC API to retrieve Earth imagery captured by the DSCOVR satellite. The API provides access to both natural and enhanced color images taken on specific dates. By integrating this API, users can explore stunning images of our planet taken from space.

### Challenges Faced

1. **API Key Handling**: One challenge was securely handling the NASA API key. used environment variables through Vite (`import.meta.env`) to store the key securely and access it within the application.

2. **Date Formatting**: The API requires dates to be in a specific format. faced challenges in formatting dates correctly to match the API's requirements. However, resolved this by converting JavaScript Date objects to the required ISO format using `toISOString()`.

3. **Data Handling**: The API responses contain various data fields, and handling them dynamically posed a challenge. addressed this by parsing the response data and displaying relevant information based on user selections.

4. **Image Format**: Initially, images were not fetched in PNG format, causing issues with rendering. To resolve this,  modified the image URL to explicitly request the PNG format from the API.

### Resolution

1. **API Key Handling**: securely stored the NASA API key in a Vite environment variable (`VITE_NASA_API_KEY`). This approach keeps the key out of version control and ensures security.

2. **Date Formatting**: To correctly format dates for API requests,  used JavaScript's `toISOString()` method to convert Date objects into the required format. This ensured compatibility with the API's date parameters.

3. **Data Handling**: parsed the API response data and displayed relevant information dynamically based on user selections. This involved conditional rendering of components and fields, ensuring a seamless user experience.

4. **Image Format**: updated the image URL to explicitly request the PNG format from the API. By appending `.png` to `imageData.image`, ensured that images are fetched in the desired PNG format, resolving rendering issues.

## Mars Rover Photos Viewer

### Overview
The Mars Rover Photos Viewer component in our application utilizes the Mars Rover Photos API provided by NASA. This API allows users to retrieve photos taken by NASA's Mars rovers. Users can specify the Mars sol (solar day on Mars), the rover's camera, and pagination options to explore various photographs captured on the Martian surface.

### API Description
The Mars Rover Photos API offers access to a comprehensive collection of images from different cameras mounted on three rovers â€” Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit â€” based on several parameters:
- `sol`: Mars solar day of the rover mission.
- `camera`: Specific camera on the rover.
- `page`: Pagination parameter for the response.

### Implementation Details
The `Mars` component is implemented as a React functional component using hooks such as `useState` for managing state (e.g., selected sol, camera, and page) and `useEffect` for side effects to fetch data based on user input.

### Challenges and Solutions
#### Rate Limiting
**Challenge:** Initially, frequent API calls during development quickly led to hitting the rate limit imposed by NASA's API.
**Solution:** implemented conditional fetching to minimize unnecessary requests and introduced a simple caching mechanism to store previously fetched data. Additionally, added error handling to gracefully inform users when the rate limit has been exceeded.

#### Handling API Data Structure
**Challenge:** The API's response structure varied significantly based on the query parameters, sometimes leading to errors in rendering when data was absent.
**Solution:** added robust error handling and data structure checks before attempting to render the photos. This ensured that the application could handle empty or unexpected responses without crashing.
